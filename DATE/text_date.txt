8
We live in a twilight world. And there are no friends at dusk.
We all believe we'd run into the burning building.
But until we feel that heat, we can never know.
Maybe that's every man's decision to make for himself.
Weaving another past in the fabric of this mission.
We just saved the world. Can't leave anything to chance.
You're waiting for a train, a train that will take you far away.
An idea is like a virus, resilient, highly contagious.
